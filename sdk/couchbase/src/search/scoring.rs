//! Scoring definitions for Full-Text Search results, including score fusion.
//!
//! Score fusion controls how the FTS and vector result sets of a hybrid search are merged
//! into a single ranked list. It is only meaningful for a hybrid request (both an FTS query
//! and a vector search); applied to a single result set, it re-scores the hits but leaves
//! their ordering unchanged.
//!
//! Use the [`Scoring`] enum to pass a scoring mode to
//! [`SearchOptions::scoring`](crate::options::search_options::SearchOptions::scoring).

/// Selects how search results are scored.
///
/// Use with [`SearchOptions::scoring`](crate::options::search_options::SearchOptions::scoring).
