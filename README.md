# Couchbase Rust SDK

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/couchbase/couchbase-jvm-clients?color=brightgreen)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This repository contains the Couchbase Rust SDK.
This project is currently in development and not yet production ready.

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple crates that work together to provide the complete Couchbase Rust SDK:

- **`couchbase`** - Main SDK crate providing the, public, high-level API.
- **`couchbase-core`** - Core networking and protocol implementation, not intended for direct use.
- **`couchbase-connstr`** - Connection string parsing and DNS resolution, not intended for direct use.
- **`protostellar`** - Couchbase2 protocol support, not intended for direct use.

## Quick Start

Add the Couchbase SDK to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
cargo add couchbase
```

## Building from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-rs
cd sdk/couchbase
cargo build 
```

## Testing

Tests use the standard Rust testing framework. To run tests:

```
cd sdk/couchbase
export RCBCONNSTR="couchbases://127.0.0.1
export RCBCUSERNAME="username"
export RCBCPASSWORD="password"
cargo test
```

For a full list of available environment variables, see the [Testing Environment Variables](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-rs/blob/main/sdk/couchbase/tests/common/test_config.rs).

### Test coverage

Whilst some integration tests are included in the main SDK crate, more extensive tests are run via the Couchbase FIT tool.

### Benchmarks

```bash
# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmark
cargo bench collection_crud
```

Benchmarks share the same environment variables as tests.

## Branching Strategy

The rust SDK follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) strategy.
Dotpatch releases contain only bug fixes.
Dotminor releases may contain new features, but are backwards compatible.
Dotmajor releases are very, very infrequent.

The `main` branch is where development for the next minor release happens.
For each new change a new branch is created and then the change is merged back into `main` via a pull request.

Maintenance branches are named `x.y` where `x` is the major version and `y` is the minor version.
Instead of committing directly to a maintenance branch, first commit to `main` and then cherry-pick to the maintenance branch if possible.

## Documentation

Coming soon.
