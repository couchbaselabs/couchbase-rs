# Couchbase Rust SDK

## Deprecation notice

This branch/version of the SDK is deprecated in favor of a fully native version that is currently in development on
the [nativex branch](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-rs/tree/nativex).
Once the native SDK is considered to be complete enough it will be moved into this (master) branch.

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/couchbase.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/couchbase)

## Requirements

Make sure to have all [libcouchbase](https://docs.couchbase.com/c-sdk/current/start-using-sdk.html) requirements satisfied to build it properly. Also [bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html) requirements need to be in place. You need a rust version newer or equal to `1.77.2` because this SDK makes heavy use of `async/await`.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
couchbase = "1.0.0-alpha.5"
```

## Usage

The `examples` folder has a bunch more, but here is a basic getting started doing a kv op:

```rust
pub fn main() {
    // Connect to the cluster with a connection string and credentials
    let cluster = Cluster::connect("couchbase://127.0.0.1", "Administrator", "password");
    // Open a bucket
    let bucket = cluster.bucket("travel-sample");
    // Use the default collection (needs to be used for all server 6.5 and earlier)
    let collection = bucket.default_collection();

    // Fetch a document
    match block_on(collection.get("airline_10", GetOptions::default())) {
        Ok(r) => println!("get result: {:?}", r),
        Err(e) => println!("get failed! {}", e),
    };

    // Upsert a document as JSON
    let mut content = HashMap::new();
    content.insert("Hello", "Rust!");

    match block_on(collection.upsert("foo", content, UpsertOptions::default())) {
        Ok(r) => println!("upsert result: {:?}", r),
        Err(e) => println!("upsert failed! {}", e),
    };
}
```

## Examples

More examples can be found in the `examples` folder. Please open a ticket if something is not present or does not
showcase what you need.

## Unsafe Code

This code contains **unsafe {}** code blocks. Breathe slowly and calm down, it's going to be okay. The reason why we use
unsafe code is so that we can call into `libcouchbase` which is a C library. The only unsafe code is found in the lcb
part of the IO module. So if you experience a segfault, it will likely come from there. We are trying to even keep
unsafe in there minimal, but by the nature of it, it is all over the place. We are also working on a pure Rust SDK with
no unsafe code (hopefully), but until this ships and is mature we have to live with it.
